# TCP_PortScanner  

A TCP port scanner is a tool that allows a user to identify open TCP ports on a target system. The scanner operates by sending TCP connection requests to a range of ports on the target system and analyzing the responses it receives. If a connection request receives a response, the port is considered open, indicating that a service is running on that port. The scanner can also attempt to identify the service running on the open port by sending additional requests and analyzing the responses. Port scanners can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes, such as network security assessments, vulnerability testing, and reconnaissance for potential attacks. It is important to use port scanners ethically and with appropriate permissions to avoid causing harm or violating laws and regulations.  

The given port scanner scans the ports in four different ports   

* TCP
* UDP
* SYN
* FIN  

gives you the open ports and the time taken in seconds
